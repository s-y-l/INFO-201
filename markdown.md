# Hi, name is Sooyong!
I'm currently an English major, taking this class for fun. There are **two** main things I would like to learn in this class:

## Basics of coding
I only know the basics of C, limited to what I self-learned over spring break. I am curious to see how R is different!

_So far, in C I have learned:_
- Basic syntax
- Loops
- Data types
- Operators
- Arrays
- Basic commands like printf and srlen

## Basics of informatics
This is my first info class, so I'm excited to learn about what informatics is all about!
